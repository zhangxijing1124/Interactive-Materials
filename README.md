# Smart Bicycle Sharing System

A world in which all vehicles are self-driving, and all transportation exist in smarter forms. At the same time, a brand new Smart Bicycle Sharing System has been developed. Users can borrow and return bicycles at any location. When the user needs to use the bicycle, he or she only needs to use the APP to call one, the bicycle will come to the user's location through the self-driving and self-balancing technology. After the user arrives, the bicycle is redeployed to the location where the next user is most likely to borrow it by the algorithm.
